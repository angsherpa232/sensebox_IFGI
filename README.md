# sensebox_IFGI

This xml code can be edited or simply compiled with [<b>blockly for senseBox</b>](https://blockly.sensebox.de/ardublockly/?board=sensebox-mcu#). The compiled sketch.bin file can then be deployed in Arduino-toolkit. The main aim is to collect the data of different environmental parameters such as Temperature, Relative humidity, illuminance and Pressure. The unit of these parameters are °C, %, lux, and hectoPascal(hPa) respectively.

## How it works
The program is designed to collect the data in every minute and store them in the micro-sd embeded in the Arduion board. The full documentation of Blockly for senseBox can be found [here](https://sensebox.github.io/books-v2/blockly/en/).

This task was carried out as a final project for a block course in [Institute of Geoinformatics (IFGI)](https://www.uni-muenster.de/Geoinformatics/en/).
